# 🗺️ Map Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Your ListSpace component now includes comprehensive map functionality that can detect user location and show nearby parking spaces with directions. The system works exactly as you requested - if you're in Mufakose, it will pick up your coordinates and direct you to nearby parking spaces.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **ParkingMap Component** (`src/components/ParkingMap.jsx`)
- Interactive map using Leaflet and React-Leaflet
- Custom markers for different parking statuses:
  - 🟢 Green: Available spaces
  - 🟡 Yellow: Nearly full (< 20% available)
  - 🔴 Red: Full (0 spaces)
  - 🔵 Blue: Your current location
- Click markers to see details and get directions
- "Find Me" button to get current GPS location
- Automatic directions to Google Maps

### 2. **LocationService** (`src/services/locationService.js`)
- GPS location detection
- Distance calculations between points
- Zimbabwe-specific location suggestions
- Mock data for demonstration (includes Mufakose, Harare CBD, etc.)
- API integration with fallback to mock data

### 3. **Enhanced ListSpace** (`src/pages/ListSpace.jsx`)
- Toggle between List View and Map View
- Location detection with status indicators
- Search radius control (1-20 km)
- Distance display for each parking space
- Popular Zimbabwe locations quick-select

### 4. **Map Demo Page** (`src/components/MapDemo.jsx`)
- Standalone demo to test all functionality
- Accessible at `/map-demo` route
- Includes Mufakose location simulation
